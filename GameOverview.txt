Solar is a turn-based colony management game focused on building a resilient off-world solar farm.
Players place energy-generating structures on a hex-like grid, balance demand from nearby habitats,
and invest in storage solutions that buffer against volatile weather patterns. Each turn is driven by
three primary systems:

1. **Grid management** – Structures must be placed on available tiles, respecting build limits and
   adjacency requirements for upgrades.
2. **Energy resolution** – Sunlight intensity for the turn determines gross energy production, which
   is offset by structure upkeep and colony demand.
3. **Storage and deficit tracking** – Excess energy flows into batteries while shortages draw from
   existing reserves and are tracked as critical deficits that reduce morale.

Known design expectations from early prototypes:

- Solar panels gain a small bonus when networked in clusters to reward thoughtful placement.
- Batteries should never allow total stored energy to exceed their rated capacity or fall below zero.
- Any demand that cannot be met after discharging storage must be recorded so that downstream
  systems (population, research pace) can react appropriately.

The current codebase targets these systems with a lightweight simulation module used by both the
CLI prototype and future UI layers. The module should provide:

- A `GameState` object capable of validating placements, advancing turns, and emitting structured
  turn reports.
- Immutable structure definitions for solar panels, batteries, and consumer buildings.
- Deterministic rules that a designer can unit test to guard against regressions.
